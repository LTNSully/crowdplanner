Mapping Tool to predict or verify crowd sizes

This is a personal project to showcase my current skills in developping/coding/designing.

The website will show a map (Google) and allow the user to draw shapes on it.
Using that shape it will calculate the seurface area and provide a crowd size based on a desired density.

This tool can be used by event planners to estimate attendance numbers for logistical, financial or safety purposes. If using it
in such manner, be aware that this is a planning tool alone and by no means supercedes local government bylaws and rules.
It can also be used to estimate a crowd size of an event (protest, concert, fair, etc.) seen on TV/News/Social media.
